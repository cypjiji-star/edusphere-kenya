# **App Name**: EduSphere Kenya

## Core Features:

- Multi-Tenancy Architecture: Isolate each school's data and access, ensuring that users can only access data related to their specific school. The schools' data will be accessed via a URL structure. For example, `edusphere.com/[schoolname]`
- User Authentication & Redirection: Securely authenticate users (Admin, Teacher, Student, Developer) and redirect them to their appropriate school-specific portal based on their credentials.
- Developer School Management Tool: Enable the 'developer' user to create and manage school accounts and their associated login credentials after payment verification. Schools will be isolated and will have limited access from the Admin (developer) portal for support and emergency troubleshooting purposes. No external data will be stored in this Admin portal.
- School Portal Customization Tool: Admins can change school themes, layout, colors, and styles from the given set of design system guidelines.
- Personalized learning path generator: Using generative AI, construct learning paths to allow students to achieve defined standards. AI tool assesses student's understanding to generate best learning content
